//Take an object with the selectors of two elements into the constructor: one
//containing the user's name, and another containing the user's job.

//Store a public method named getUserInfo(), which returns an object with
//information about the user. This method will be handy for cases when it's
//necessary to display the user data in the open form.

//Store a public method named setUserInfo(), which takes new user data and adds it on the page.

//Create an instance of the UserInfo class in index.js. Use its method setUserInfo()
//to handle the form submission inside an instance of the PopupWithForm class.
